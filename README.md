# vadose_multiphase
A python script for modeling 1-D multiphase flow, based on a method-of-lines approach to solving a modified form of the Richards equation.

The following tab-delimited input files are required:

* (prefix)_input.txt - problem definition: liquid and medium properties, special cells, sources, etc.
* times.txt - output times

More background information can be found here: https://numericalenvironmental.wordpress.com/2016/07/11/multiphase-flow/

I'd appreciate hearing back from you if you find the script useful. Questions or comments are welcome at walt.mcnab@gmail.com.
